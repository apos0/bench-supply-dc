These modules are designed exclusively as step-down converters. To maximize their efficiency, youâ€™ll need a reliable power supply, ideally providing more than 24V and 2A. In my setup, I included a step-up converter to increase the voltage to 45V. I also added silicone pads to the bottom for improved grip.
